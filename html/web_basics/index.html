<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>I'm inviting you into my dog-obsessed world. Glad you could make it. </p>
<p>You might be asking, "What's so great about <strong>dogs</strong>? They're just furry creatures that need to be cared for and take up <em>a lot</em> of your time, right?"</p>
<p>Well, my friend, it depends how you look at it. Here are a few reasons why I believe <a href="packdog.com">dogs</a> are a dream come true.</p>
<ol>
	<li>They'll greet you with a smile 99% of the time</li>
	<li>They'll love you no matter what...unless you don't tell them who the good boy really is...</li>
	<li>They're very therapeautic and will always be there for you to confide in, even if it's just admitting that you had that extra piece of cake.</li>
</ol>
<p><h4>Dogs I Love &#128021;</h4></p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite types of dogs, in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Labrador Retrievers</li>
	<li>French Bulldogs</li>
	<li>Bernese Mountain Dogs</li>
	<li>Pugs, especially when they have weak tongue muscles</li>
	<li>Golden Retrievers</li>
</ul>
